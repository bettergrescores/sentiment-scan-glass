# BlueKaktus Dashboard - Design Documentation

## Overview
BlueKaktus Dashboard is a web application designed for fashion businesses to analyze customer sentiment and feedback. It provides visualizations and insights to help understand customer opinions and make data-driven decisions.

## Design Choices

### Technology Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: Chosen for type safety and component reusability
- **Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS**: For consistent, accessible UI components and responsive design
- **Context API**: For global state management (authentication, theming)
- **React Router**: For client-side navigation between dashboard sections
- **Recharts**: For data visualization components

### UI/UX Design
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Improves mobile experience and maximizes screen space
- **Dashboard Layout**: Side navigation with main content area for visualizations
- **Card-Based Interface**: Modular components for different data insights
- **Data Visualization**: Various chart types to present complex data simply
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices

### Authentication
- **Custom Auth Flow**: Email/password and Google authentication options
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access dashboard
- **Local Storage**: For persistent authentication sessions

## Assumptions Made

1. **Data Structure**: Mock data assumes a specific structure for products and reviews that would match real API responses
2. **Offline-First Approach**: Application works with mock data, assuming connection to backend API in production
3. **User Authentication**: Simple authentication model without complex roles or permissions
4. **Primary Desktop Usage**: Most analytical work would be done on desktop devices, with mobile support for basic viewing

## Challenges Encountered

### Technical Challenges
1. **Interactive Visualizations**: Balancing rich interactivity and performance
2. **Responsive Charts**: Ensuring visualizations remain useful on all screen sizes
3. **Type Safety**: Maintaining proper TypeScript types across components
4. **Component Structure**: Breaking down complex UI into manageable, reusable pieces
5. **Collapsible Sidebar**: Creating a responsive sidebar that works well on all devices

### UX Challenges
1. **Information Density**: Presenting comprehensive data without overwhelming users
2. **Data Context**: Providing sufficient context for meaningful analysis
3. **Loading States**: Managing transitions for smooth user experience
4. **Mobile Experience**: Preserving functionality on smaller screens
5. **Intuitive Navigation**: Making the app easy to explore and use

## Future Improvements
1. **Backend Integration**: Connecting to real APIs for live data
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Cross-dataset comparisons and multi-dimensional filtering
3. **Additional Visualizations**: More chart types for deeper analysis
4. **Expanded User Management**: User roles and permissions
5. **Performance Optimization**: Further chart rendering and data processing improvements
